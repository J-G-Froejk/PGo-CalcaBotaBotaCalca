## This action block does nothing, it just populates your CalcyIV history with
## all your pokémon. If you want to save them automatically as well, activate the
## option "Save Appraised Pokémon" and uncomment (remove the #) at lines 19 and 20.

## You could also set Calcy to save any and every scanned pokémon, in advanced settings,
## though I'd strongly advise you then set --max-retries=1, otherwise the chance of
## getting false duplicates (or even triplicates) is very high.
