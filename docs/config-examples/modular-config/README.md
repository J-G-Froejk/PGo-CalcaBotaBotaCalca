MODULAR CONFIG
##############

**This will be always a WIP, as they are literally my own personal configs, which I update (i.e.: copy over) to the repo's docs periodically.** Don't expect nothing pretty or organized, it's just here for reference.

----

This is even more complex than the `ridiculously-complex-config.yaml` example, but allows you to easily set up different actions for different situations, quickly change between device's coords and waits, and so on.

_Also, take a look at [config.yaml](./config.yaml) first and foremost, to grasp the idea about how this works..._
