## Add your own pokémons to skip renaming in the file blacklist.yaml
## The default set includes only pokémons that *can cause false positives*.
blacklist: !include blacklist.yaml

## The ruleset below is as basic as it gets.
## If you wanna get fancy and customize your own renaming scheme take a look
## at the examples in docs/actions/. There's also a prefix order list in the
## file ACTIONS.md, so you can customize the order in which your pokémon will
## be shown when sorting by A-Z.
actions:
    # Renames failed scans for manual verification:
    - conditions:
        success: false
      actions:
        rename: "! Failed"

    # Renames everything else exactly as your CalcyIV setup:
    - conditions:
        success: true
      actions:
        rename: {calcy}
